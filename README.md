# reGI (reverse-engineered GestINF)
A minimal, clumsy quotation generator for a small business.
Made with:
- [peewee 3.9.6](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/index.html), a small and useful ORM for Python ;
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), one of the most powerful and well-known Python GUIs;
- [Python 3.6.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/).

## What does it do?
reGI allows the user to add clients to a database, create models of fixtures, and create price quotations based on the product type, size and variants. It is especially thought for a small carpentering business, so it revolves around wooden doors, windows and other fixtures.

## Will it ever be properly working and stable?
I doubt it. There are many sides to this project I'd like to improve substantially, but it'll inevitably take a lot of time.


### Changelog
- a0.2.1: further developed GUI and color palette.
- a0.2.0: further developed GUI and assigned slots to some buttons.
- a0.1.1: added a very rudimental version of the first two GUI pages.
- a0.1.0: first version of the program. Practically nonexistant, LOL.
