# reGI (reverse-engineered GestINF)
A minimal and simple quotation generator for a small business.
Made with:
- [peewee 3.13.3](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/index.html), a small and useful ORM for Python (the SQLite engine is being used for the database);
- [PyQt5 5.15.0](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/), one of the most powerful and well-known Python GUIs;
- [Python 3.8.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/).

## What does it do?
reGI allows the user to add clients to a database, create models of fixtures, and create price quotations based on the product type, size and variants. It is especially thought for a small carpentering business, so it revolves around wooden doors, windows and other fixtures.

## Will it ever be properly working and stable?
I doubt it. There are many sides to this project I'd like to improve substantially, but it'll inevitably take a lot of time.


### Changelog
